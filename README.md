# go-poc

Proof of Concept (PoC) Objective:
The primary goal of this PoC is to showcase the implementation of a Go service capable of logging reverse IPs from incoming requests. Additionally, the project includes a Helm chart for efficient deployment on a Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) cluster and Infrastructure as Code (IaC) in Terraform to automate the deployment of GKE and Cloud SQL with PostgreSQL.

This PoC have the following: 

* go service doing saving reverse IP in all requests
** project builded on go with gin framework and gorm for storing on DBMS
** healthcheck added / not counting 
** ip saved over postgres database 
** added basic CRUD for IP operations
* dockerfile
* helm chart to deploy to GKE cluster
* Iac code in terraform to deploy GKE and Cloudsql/Postgres
* 2 github actions pipelines:
** 1 builds and deploys the code
** 1 create Iac if detects changes over `iac` folder

---
out of the scope:
* GCP: docker artifactory, apis GCP/CLOUDSQL enabled manually and bucket to save TFSTATE
* I create a github action secret to save DB_URL for application and pass it to helm chart

findings : 

* I was force to create an exception for `/healthz`  path to avoid filling the database  of the cluster requests for the liveness and readinessprobes.


### example requests 

right now Ingress for the application is the following : `34.122.29.18`

* any `IP/path`
```
curl --location 'http://34.122.29.18' \
--data ''
